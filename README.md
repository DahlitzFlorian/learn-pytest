## Description ##
This repository is a collection of smaller snippets, examples, and projects
created to teach myself the usage of pytest. It's made for educational
purposes only and to document my own progress.

The `src` directory contains the source code to be tested against.
`test` contains all the tests and `docs` some Markdown files explaining
certain things for self-documentation.
